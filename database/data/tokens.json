The term deposit bonus for 1 year is about 100% - so at the end of the term you&#39;d have 110 HODL (Capital 100 + Interest 5 + Term Deposit Bonus 5).

Xaurum is ment to be used as a store of value since the gold base that backs Xaurum is always growing.<\/p><p>The former cryptocurrency,\u00a0Xaurum (XAU) had an ICO period, in which 1016 XAU coins were sold. In the RICO period, these XAU coins are exchangeable for XAUR at a 1-8000 rate. During this RICO period, anyone was also allowed to send cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to the Auresco Institute to recieve newly created XAUR.\u00a0<\/p><p>In this smart contract system, the old PoS XAU coins that were swapped and the ones that were minted in the RICO period will be\u00a0in circulation (all of these coins have been backed by gold), and the remaining supply is locked (the locked supply is not backed by gold). Xaurum users have two ways of acquiring tokens, you can earn them in the \"Goldmine\" or Mint them.\u00a0<\/p><p>When mining on the Goldmine, users are exchanging their hashpower in a multipool. The earned coins\u00a0from staking and mining these cryptocurrencies is used to buy more gold and to release Xaurum that was previously locked into circulation, by backing it with the newly bought gold.\u00a0The\u00a0proceeds from the Multipool can also be used to buy Xaurum in an exchange and pay the miners, depending on the market value of Xaurum, mined cryptocurrencies and the gold itself.\u00a0<\/p><p>when Minting new coins, users are allowed to send fiat currencies directly to the Auresco Institute in exchange for new coins. These users are called Masternodes but they do not mantain the blockchain. Instead, they are required to have a 1000 XAUR collateral (like Dash masternodes), in order to create new coins. This ensures that any fraud attempt would not be profitable for the Xaurum masternodes.<\/p><p>Profits from running the PoW multipool and from the Minting process are sent to the Commonwealth wallet, and allow the Xaurum system to increase their gold supply at a must faster pace than the XAUR supply itself.<\/p>","features":"","technology":"","twitter":"@urumproject","logo":"xaur.png","website":"<a href='http:\/\/www.xaurum.org\/' target='_blank'>Xaurum<\/a>","mining_proof":"","total_supply":"127108472.4829"},"354":{"address":"0xB110eC7B1dcb8FAB8dEDbf28f53Bc63eA5BEdd84","symbol":"XID","decimal":8,"name":"Sphre AIR","description":"<p>Air claims to be a highly secure platform for digital identity, based on the Hyperledger blockchain.
